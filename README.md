## 📂 Folder Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

### 🔹 For C++ Projects
- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the project  
- `.h` and `.cpp` files: Well-structured and separated by classes  
- Optional `README.md`: Explaining the individual project  

### 🔹 For Java Projects
- `Main.java` or project-specific entry file  
- Classes separated into their own `.java` files  
- Optional `README.md` for project documentation
